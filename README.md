<h2> Welcome to my Github Profile </h2>

<h2> About me </h2>
- I am an enthusiastic Pre-final year student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology with a specialization in IT, from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, India.
<br>
- I am passionate about AI and its application to healthcare. I see my future as undertaking a deep body of research on a healthcare AI application and contributing to driving innovation in that field.
<br>
- Meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds gives me immense pleasure. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and make them feel comfortable in my presence.
<br>
- Something I believe in is “Knowledge is power. Knowledge shared is power multiplied.” <br>
That’s the reason I love sharing my experiences. Also, forgot to mention I love teaching subjects in which I have good knowledge :)<br>
- I have been an active leader in various professional development societies such as the ACM student chapter. I organized multiple technical events to foster collaboration in learning in youth and am always open to Collaborations!
